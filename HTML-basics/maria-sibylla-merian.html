<blockquote>
    <em>I spent my time investigating insects. At the beginning, I started with silk worms in my home town of Frankfurt. I realized that other caterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths, and that silkworms did the same. This led me to collect all the caterpillars I could find in order to see how they changed. </em>

<p>
    Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717) was a German-born naturalist and scientific illustrator. From a young age she had access to many books about natural history, and was fascinated by insects of all sorts. In 1699 Merian and her daughter traveled to Surinam, where she worked for two years observing and sketching local plants and insects. In 1705, she published her greatest work, <u>Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium</u>, about the insects of Surinam.

    Merian's was among the first to observe and draw insects in their own environment.  Her work greatly influenced the field of scientific illustration because of her dedication to realism and accuracy, and because her pictures were the first to illustrate all stages of an insect's life, from chrysalis to death. Today, Merian is regarded as one of the best scientific illustrators of insects and flora of all time.
